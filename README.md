# AI Programming with Python Project - Image Classifier

This is a image classifier coded for the "Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree" program using neural networks.

The Image Classifier recognize different species of flowers (102 classes).

In this project, i first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then i converted it into a command line application.

## Jupyter Notebook

For a first look of the Jupyter Notebook, i suggest to use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/samux87/Image_Classifier/blob/master/Image%20Classifier%20Project.ipynb)

Otherwise, you can open it in [pdf](https://github.com/samux87/Image_Classifier/blob/master/Image%20Classifier%20Project.pdf) format.
