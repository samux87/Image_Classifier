# AI Programming with Python Project - Image Classifier

This is a image classifier coded for the "Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree" program using neural networks.

The Image Classifier recognize different species of flowers (102 classes).

In this project, i first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then i converted it into a command line application.
